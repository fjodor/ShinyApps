# ShinyTitanic
A small shiny app to explore a simple decision tree model (rpart) on titanic training data.

Only three predictor variables are displayed: gender, age, and passenger class.

Interactive options:

Choose whether surrogate variables are used to substitute missing predictor values (here, more variables are being used).

Select how the first split is determined:   
  By the algorithm (which selects gender);  
  Enforce age;  
  Enforce passenger class.
